# SublimeSettings
Packages and Settings for a Sublime Text 3 installation

## Installation
Clone 'https://github.com/ivanovsky55/SublimeSettings.git' to '%AppData%\Sublime Text\' on a local repo called 'Packages'

Ctrl+Shift+P, then 'Install Package Control' (this will automatically download all packages)

Extract 'A File Icon.zip' into '%AppData%\Sublime Text\' (path should match 'zzz A File Icon zzz' temp folder, which will get auto-cleaned up post-extraction)
